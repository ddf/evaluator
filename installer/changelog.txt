Evaluator changelog

01/30/19 - v1.1.0

New and Changed:

* increased overall output volume of the Standalone version to match the Plugin versions
* the Plugin is now an Instrument instead of an Effect, so it can be used in DAWs that will only send MIDI to Instruments (eg Fruity)
* improved conditional operator so it uses branching and can be used without the colon
* added ==, !=, <=, and >= relational operators
* improved VOL and V knobs so that hovering over the knob displays the current value above it
* macOS builds are now only 64-bit (macOS no longer supports building 32-bit)

Bug Fixes:

* better handling of audio intialization failure
* fixed handling of line-endings in the Program Window
* fixed line-spacing on macOS in the Program Window
* fixed handling of overlapped MIDI notes

02/03/18 - v1.0.1

* fixed implementation of R operator
* fixed possible MIDI related crash at startup in Windows
* improved language syntax reference
* improved UI look and text box behavior
